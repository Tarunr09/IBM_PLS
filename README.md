üöÄ Introduction
The Speech Generator Application is a powerful tool for creating custom speeches based on user-selected topics and stylistic preferences. The application utilizes the Google Generative AI (Gemini 1.5) model to craft speeches with a balance of logical (left-brain) and creative (right-brain) elements. The frontend is built with React, while the backend leverages Flask to handle API requests.
